# word-scrape
Python program that takes in letters as input and returns every word that can be made with those letters. Inspired by the iPhone game Wordscapes. 

To run this file, download the word_finder.py and everyword.rtf files in this repository. Move them to the Documents file on your computer. 

Next open the Command Prompt or Terminal (depending on if you're using a Windows computer or a Mac). 

Once you're in the Command Prompt/Terminal, type "cd Documents/" and press enter. Type in the following command:

`python3 word_finder.py`. 

A window will now pop up that will prompt you to enter letters. Now all you have to do is enter the letters you want and the program will search through a list of over 58,000 words for words that match your letters.

Whenever you want to stop the progam, click the Exit button in the bottom left. If you look at your Command Prompt/Terminal, you should see some output that tells you how long the program ran for, how many letter combinations were computed, and how many word were generated.
