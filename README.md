# word-scrape
Python program that takes in letters as input and returns every word that can be made with those letters. Inspired by the iPhone game Wordscapes. 

To run this file, download the word_finder.py file in this repository. 
### Next open the Command Prompt or Terminal (depending on if you're using a Windows computer or a Mac). Once you're in the Command Prompt/Terminal, type "cd Documents/" and press enter. Next, type "python3 word_finder.py". You should see a line that says "Enter letters:". Now all you have to do is enter the letters you want and the program will search through a list of over 58,000 words for words that match your letters.
